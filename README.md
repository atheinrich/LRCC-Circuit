# Probe-Circuit-Simulation
Numerical simulation of a parallel LRC circuit with an additional capacitor for capacitive coupling. Variable parameters include capacitances, inductance, inductive resistance, input voltage, input impedance, and input frequency.

A differential equation may be constructed as follows to represent the change in electric charge over time of an LRC circuit.
